This is the app that lets brewers get into brewing the way they want to. 

My issues with getting in to brewing:
1. didn't know how
2. the idea of having to brew a batch of "starter person beer" to learn about the process first didn't seem like too much fun...and the result, some generic tasting beer is not exiting.  
3.  the real fun about the process is thinking of your favorite beer, finding a recipe and cloning it.  

Phase 1:
Create Tutorial/Workflow for making first batch of beer
		Consider: first use is a step by step walk through:
				//1. Are you ready to brew a batch?  Or just learning about the site?
				//1a. Ready to brew -> takes the user through the process step by step, with 					ability to skip steps.

Phase 2: 
Users create their own "methods" of brewing ( phase 1 includes the standardized method provided by morebeer )
Phase 2b: Create commentary system around different styles of brewing: comments, ratings of.

Phase 3: follow up with users -> how was the taste of the beer you brewed.  Data analytics on the results to drive future picking of methods/recipes.  

Phase 4: Tie in to local breweries to offer discounts when you clone their beers (find list of locations that offer the recipes to the clones of their beers).  Have restaurant of brewery offer deal of: visit brewery within 3 weekends of 60 days after beer has been brewed (or whatever the optimal period is.  receive 6 free beers to do a side by side comparison.  book the weekend.  change the weekend.  etc. )

Ways to Make Money:
1. Ordering beer ingredients through app
2. Referral fee/ comission from groups sent to breweries
